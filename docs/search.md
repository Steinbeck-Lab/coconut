# Structure Based Search

## Structure Search

### Visual Structure Search

Search for compounds by **providing a visual depiction** of their structure. This method is especially effective due to the complex naming conventions arising from the numerous functional groups.

::: tip
Simply upload or draw the structure, and our search engine will recognize it using **InChI** and **canonical SMILES** formats. This approach allows for easy discovery of all relevant characteristics of a compound.

## Exact Match Search

### InChI Search

Our search engine supports various types of **InChI structural formulas**:

- **Expanded Structural Formula**  
  Displays all bonds between atoms within the compound.

- **Condensed Structural Formula**  
  Represents the sequence of atom symbols, typically omitting bond dashes.  
  - Vertical bonds are excluded.  
  - Horizontal bonds may be included to specify polyatomic groups.  
  - Repeated polyatomic groups are shown with parentheses and a subscript indicating repetition count.

- **Skeletal Formula**  
  Represents the carbon skeleton and attached functional groups.  
  - Carbon and hydrogen atoms attached to carbon are not shown.  
  - Bonds between carbon atoms and functional groups are depicted.

### Canonical SMILES Search

**Canonical SMILES** is a unique string that identifies a specific chemical structure, including stereochemistry. Use this option to proceed with structure drawing, where you can also explore:

- **3D Structure Representation**  
  This involves using models to represent the spatial orientation of covalent bonds in simple molecules.  
  
  **Valence Shell Electron Pair Repulsion (VSEPR) Theory** provides five main models for 3D structures:  
  - Linear  
  - Trigonal Planar  
  - Tetrahedral  
  - Trigonal Bipyramidal  
  - Octahedral

## Substructure Search

### Partial Structure Search

Search for compounds by entering a known **substructure** using **InChI** or **SMILES** formats. 

::: info
Our search engine supports three advanced algorithms to refine your search.
:::

## Similarity Search

### Tanimoto Threshold

Find compounds with a similarity score **greater than or equal** to the specified **Tanimoto coefficient**. This feature is useful for identifying compounds closely related to the query structure.

## Advanced Search

### Molecular Descriptors and Structural Properties

Leverage our advanced search feature to explore specific **molecular descriptors** that quantify physical and chemical characteristics. You can also focus your search within specific data sources compiled in our database.

## Result Filtering

### Curation Status Filter

You can filter search results based on the curation status of compounds:

- **All** (Default): Shows all compounds regardless of their curation status
- **Approved**: Shows only compounds that have been reviewed and approved by curators
- **Revoked**: Displays compounds that have been revoked or deprecated

::: tip Default Filter
By default, the search results show **All** compounds. You can use the status dropdown menu to filter and view only approved or revoked compounds as needed.
